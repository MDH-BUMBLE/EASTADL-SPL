<b>Timing-aware variability resolution algorithm in EAST-ADL product line architecture </b> <br><br>
In BUMBLE and MoDeV projects, we are motivated to boost the Verification and Validation (V&V) activities of EAST-ADL Product Line Architectures (PLAs). As a part of projects, we propose a timing-aware variability resolution approach in EAST-ADL architecture to generate valid product variants effectively. The method relies on existing EAST-ADL product line architecture for system modeling, where several variability points at different levels of abstraction are identified. A variability resolution algorithm is proposed where several configuration decisions starting from the topmost vehicle level down to the design level are incorporated for seamless variability resolution. Furthermore, timing decisions based on analysis and design prototypes are provided to generate variant-specific timing constraints. Consequently, the verification of product variants can be performed instantly in the presence of variant-specific timing constraints. The approach is validated via car wiper use case from our industrial partner, where three product variants comprising a full system model with associated timing constraints are generated successfully. <br>
The timing-aware variability resolution algorithm is implemented in JAVA that operates on EAXML format to offer broader tool-independent execution on EAST-ADL PLAs. The implementation architecture is shown in Figure 1. <br> <br>

Here, we demonstrate the application of timing-aware variability resolution algorithm via care wiper use case <b> (CarWiper-three.eaxml) </b> with three variants. Detailed installation instructions are available in <b> Installation-Guide.pdf </b>. Main steps to reproduce results - how to perform experimentation are described in <b> User-Manual.pdf </b>. The implementations (source code) of timing-aware variability resolution algorithm, as Eclipse project archive file, are given in <b> Var-resolution.zip </b>.
